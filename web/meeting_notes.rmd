# Next Meeting

- Worked on updating the interval finding function to be more stable but continued running into issues. I really think this stems back to instability in computing the proportionality constant. 
- I also say issues arrising from skewed posteriors which make finding density from the posterior mode potentially have issues, but these could also stem back to the earlier point made. I think this method would be potentially the most stable option but everything relies heavily on computing that normalizing constant.
- I need to recover the word where I try and estimate the bounds from the mode. Which I think should just take some uncommenting.

# Running To-Do

- Visualize the posterior in a single dimension for Bayesian bootstraps
- Double check what the intervals look like (in terms of average width, # times width = 0 still)
- Create mre for "Error: Supplied lambda value(s) are outside the range of the model fit."

## To Discuss

- Initial results from "Simple Empirical Bayes Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals"
  - The results look bizarre, particularly for variables with zero as the true coefficient.
- Efficient Empirical Bayes Variable Selection and Estimation in Linear Models
  - The paper suggests a method in which under specific conditions the Lasso can be used as a computational short cut for model selection / estimation using a specific hierarchical prior for a linear model. With this, the authors also propose a way to select lambda and estimate $\sigma^2$ (and hence obtaining the final model as the lasso solution).
- Would we like to set up a drop box to store data objects?

## Notes

- Work on simple versions first before trying to extend it to more complex cases.

- Look at visualizing the prior / posterior
- Look at numerical integration techniques
- Consider integrating from posterior mode (lasso solution)
x Move denominator into log to see if that would help
- Look at intervals on a simpler example
- Look into an amazon bucket (Patrick could host)
- Look into variational bayes for lasso, or generally if someone has tried to approximate the lasso posterior


## Action Items

- See Notes above. Need to do better next time seperating general discussion notes and what I need to work on going forward.
