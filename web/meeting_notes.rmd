# Running To-Do

- Visualize the posterior in a single dimension for Bayesian bootstraps
- Double check what the intervals look like (in terms of average width, # times width = 0 still)
- Create mre for "Error: Supplied lambda value(s) are outside the range of the model fit."

## To Discuss

- Initial results from "Simple Empirical Bayes Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals"
  - The results look bizarre, particularly for variables with zero as the true coefficient.
- Efficient Empirical Bayes Variable Selection and Estimation in Linear Models
  - The paper suggests a method in which under specific conditions the Lasso can be used as a computational short cut for model selection / estimation using a specific hierarchical prior for a linear model. With this, the authors also propose a way to select lambda and estimate $\sigma^2$ (and hence obtaining the final model as the lasso solution).
- Would we like to set up a drop box to store data objects?
